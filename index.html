        <h2>Welcome to GID109</h2>
       <p>This course is the first in a three-part series teaching front-end web design and development. The course begins with an overview of the Internet and the World Wide Web, followed by an introduction to the three layers of web development, Structure (HTML), Style (CSS) and Behavior (JavaScript). Students will hand code a variety of web page assignments to master the fundamental techniques presented in this course. Emphasis throughout the course will include the effective use of Project Planning techniques, the Principles of Design, User Experience (UX) Design, Writing and Typography for the web, validation and browser testing. Additional topics include an introduction to the Apple/Mac operating system including file management, and Copyright and the use of images on the Web. In conjunction with MWCCâ€™s Library research and information training, an information literacy module will be included and will provide the focus for one of two required large-scale Creative Website projects. Basic computer skills are required: ability to use a computer operating system and follow basic procedures including keyboarding/mouse skills, as well as system commands such as working with directories/folders, and opening/closing applications. 3 credits. Prerequisites: ENG 098, FYE 101, RDG 098, or placement.</p>
